	<question>
		<text>Question 10:
What is the difference between smoke testing and sanity testing?</text>
		<answer>Smoke testing is a preliminary testing done to quickly determine if the most critical functionalities of an application are working correctly after a build or deployment. It is performed to identify any showstopper defects that would prevent further testing. Sanity testing, on the other hand, is a narrow and focused regression testing that aims to verify the stability of specific functionality or areas of an application after making minor changes or fixes. It ensures that the recent changes haven't introduced any major issues.</answer>

		<text>Question 11:
What is the difference between manual testing and automated testing?</text>
		<answer>Manual testing involves the process of manually executing test cases without the use of automation tools. It requires human intervention to perform tests, observe results, and identify defects. Automated testing, on the other hand, involves using automation tools to execute test cases, compare results, and perform repetitive tasks. It is faster and more efficient for executing large volumes of test cases and performing regression testing.</answer>
